The frontend server will start, and you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

-yarn start

The backend server will start, and it will handle WebSocket connections via Socket.IO.

# Deployment

6. How it Works

Chat Meet allows users to chat with different people by creating rooms. To join a chat, a user needs to type their name and the room ID. When the user enters the same room ID as another user, they will be connected in the same chat room and can start chatting with each other. The room ID acts as a unique identifier to enable communication between desired individuals.
